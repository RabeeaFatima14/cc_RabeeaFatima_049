## Lab #02

### Task 1 – Download Git
Install Git on your local system.

### Task 2 – Create a Private GitHub Repository
Create a new private repository on GitHub for this lab.

### Task 3 – Connect Repository
Connect your local Git repository to the remote GitHub repository.

### Task 4 – Configure Git Username and Email
Use `git config` commands to set your username and email for commits.

### Task 5 – Explore the `.git` Folder
View the contents of the hidden `.git` folder to understand how Git tracks repository data.

### Task 6 – File Status & Staging
Check file changes with `git status`, then stage and commit updates.

### Task 7 – Branch Creation Using GitHub GUI
Create a branch using the GitHub web interface.

### Task 8 – Branch Creation & Push Using Git Bash
Create and push new branches from Git Bash using `git checkout -b` and `git push`.

### Task 9 – Branching & Merging
Practice switching between branches and merging them using `git merge`.

### Task 10 – Pull Request and Branch Review
Open a Pull Request on GitHub, review it, merge, and document screenshots.

### Task 11 – Detailed Branch Strategy (Develop/Staging)
Simulate a professional workflow with multiple branches like `develop`, `staging`, and `main`.

### Task 12 – Code Review Workflow
Perform a simple peer review or self-review to ensure quality before merging.

### Bonus Task – Simulated Team Collaboration
Collaborate with another user through GitHub:
- Both users pull the latest version.  
- Each adds their own content to `notes.txt`.  
- Commit, push, and merge back to `main`.
